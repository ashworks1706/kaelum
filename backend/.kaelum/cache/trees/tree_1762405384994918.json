      "The derivative of \\( x^2 + 3x \\) can be found by applying the power rule to each term individually. The power rule states that if you have a function of the form \\( ax^n \\), its derivative is \\( nax^{n-1} \\). Applying this rule to each term:\n\n- For \\( x^2 \\), the derivative is \\( 2x^{2-1} = 2x \\).\n- For \\( 3x \\), the derivative is \\( 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot x^{1-1} = 3 \\).\n\nThus, combining these results gives the derivative of \\( x^2 + 3x \\) as \\( 2x + 3 \\)."
