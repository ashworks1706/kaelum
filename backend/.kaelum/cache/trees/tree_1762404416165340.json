      "The task is to write a Python function that identifies prime numbers within a given range or from a list of integers. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The initial step involves defining what constitutes a prime number and understanding the algorithmic approach to check for primality efficiently."
